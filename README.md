====

Simple Python tool for fetching "some" (usable) proxies. It fetches list of public proxies (from [here](https://hidester.com)) and automatically finds in a quick manner those that are usable from running machine in that same moment (Note: testing of SOCKS proxies is currently possible only on non-Windows platforms).

Why should you use it? Well, if you've ever used free proxy lists around you'll know the pain of finding those proxies that are actually working. This tool will automatically do the list fetching and proxy testing for you.
